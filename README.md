**completed in 3rd year**
Advanced Algorithms &amp; AI Search

In this module I was introduced to search-based and other advanced algorithms.
I was also introduced to how AI (artificial intelligence) can be a solution in search-spaces.

Some of the skills I gained upon completion of this module include:
1. How to identify what type of problems are suitable for an AI approach (search, learning, self-modification of some sort).
2. How to evaluate the scale / dimensionality / searchspace size of such problems
3. How to define the search space in such problems
4. How to evaluate which AI methods are suitable for a given problem
5. How to logically estimate the division of labour needed between human effort (searchspace definition, pruning, heuristic design) and machine effort (how much of the space the machine will search in the time available)
6. How to apply some of the techniques covered in the course (search, learning, evolution)
7. How to code the techniques in the course in the student's preferred programming language
8. How to test the techniques in an Internet-based system with a massive search space and multiple conflicting goals

As continuous asessment for this module we were asked to choose an algorithm and explain it in great detail via a powerpoint presentation

I recieved an overall grade of 97%.
